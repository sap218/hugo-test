# Highlights during my Undergraduate degree

I decided to back-date this post as it covers my Undergraduate degree.
As mentioned in the [Version 3 blog]({{< ref "/hello-world" >}} "Version 3 blog"), I am not the best of writing-up some things.

I started my Undergraduate degree at Aberystwyth University in 2014. Initially I hadn't planned to leave Liverpool but I was rightfully persuaded by an IT teacher, who had sparked my interest in computers.

Initially I applied to study Computer Science, but swapped to Business IT in my second year as I couldn't get a grip on `Java`.
Although I chose some elective modules in different subject areas, I kept some core computer science fundamentals, e.g. Machine Learning.

During my undergrad degree, I've explored various programming languages and written many words/lines of code.
Both word count and lines of code peaked in my third and final year with web-based languages being my most used.
As mentioned, I couldn't figure out `Java`, which can be seen in the left plot as I only wrote a total of 31 lines...

**Note**: I would like it to be known that the above may not be 100% correct.

In the third and final year, we had the dissertation project to complete: the development of a small website with a back-end database.
I spoke to my aunt, who at the time started a small business in cake baking, and so I started production.

A lot of fellow students used `Bootstrap` for the front-end, however I wanted to make this all from scratch.
I designed elements with `CSS` including a gallery of cakes, a mini-blog, and an order form - having back-end database elements.

In my feedback, one particular quote will stick with me forever:
> one of the best websites made from scratch

I've made my [**undergraduate dissertation final report**](https://github.com/sap218/misc/blob/master/undergraduate_dissertation.pdf) available for anyone who would like to read.
I graduated in 2017 and went onto a Data Science Masters.

**Final fun facts:**
+ I was elected President of the Computer Science Society, `AberCompSoc`
+ To celebrate my graduation I made a lego minifigure of myself
+ Participated in the 2017 [BCS Lovelace Colloqium](https://github.com/sap218/misc/blob/master/lovelace_poster_2017.pdf)
+ "Assisted" a PhD student with their [PCR](https://twitter.com/sap218/status/910070653419704320) lab work 
+ My first research project in [Bioinformatics]({{< ref "/bioinformatics" >}} "Bioinformatics blog")
