# Highlights during my Undergraduate degree

I started my Undergraduate degree at [Aberystwyth University](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/cs/ "Aberystwyth University Computer Science site") in 2014.
Originally, I didn't plan on leaving Liverpool, but I was - thankfully - persuaded by an IT teacher, who sparked my interest in computers.

It's been a few years but I fondly remember enjoying Web programming, Machine Learning, and Arduino.
I struggled most with Java.

During the degree, I explored various programming languages and so written many lines of code (and words).
The Figure below visualises this: both wordcount and lines of code peaked in my third and final year.
My most used language were web-based and - as mentioned - I couldn't figure out Java and so this was my least used language: I wrote a total of 31 lines...

### Web:

My dissertation was a web project: students were to develop a site with a back-end database.
I spoke to my aunt and used their small cake business as inspiration.
See the Figure below for a screenshot of the final product.

A lot of fellow students used Bootstrap for the front-end, however I wanted challenge myself and make this from scratch with `CSS`.
In all, the website consisted of: a gallery of cakes, a mini-blog, and an order form.
One piece of feedback, which I am very proud of:
> one of the best websites made from scratch

I graduated in 2017 and that Summer I started my research journey in a small [Bioinformatics]({{< ref "bioinformatics-project" >}} "bioinformatics blog") project. 
Afterward, I went on to study a Masters degree in Data Science.
My [undergraduate dissertation](https://github.com/sap218/misc/blob/master/undergraduate_dissertation.pdf "undergraduate dissertation") is available to read.
