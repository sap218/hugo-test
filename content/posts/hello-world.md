# Version 3 has been released

I started this website journey back in 2015 using `CSS` for university assignment blogs. Then in 2021 I progressed onto GitHub pages with `Bootstrap` and a terrible repo structure. Now in 2023, Iâ€™ve decided to try **`Hugo`**. 

At first I was tempted to go with plain markdown files and simplify my pages but using `Hugo` is essentially the same, with a few extra steps, and many features.
There were lots of `Hugo` themes that were minimalistic and so it was a tough choice, a top contender was `PaperMod`. Many themes had other dependencies but I wanted something simpler.

I finalised on `Monochrome` as I liked the design and responsiveness. I've come to appreciate the autonomy and usability - for example I won't need to create any search features as it's automatic.

## Where have I been?
My last blog was 2022 and before that it was 2021 - I'd like to find more time to post more about work or projects. So where was I this past year? 

I had my PhD graduation! Now officially a **Doctor in Clinical Informatics**. I've been in my current job since 2022, a Data Wrangler/Data Scientist...
