# My experience of the PhD application process

During my time as a mentor for undergrduates and teaching assistant for Masters students, I've had questions about the PhD application process.
Now as a PhD student with a bunch of curated responses, the following post is the advice I gave.

The following advice could be helpful, if not: that's OK. 
**Please note**: the advice below was not mine alone as I had asked fellow PhD students and others.

## What to highlight in the application essay?

Many PhD applications require an essay of a few hundred words why this programme best fits you.
One of the first things to highlight is your interest in the programme/the specific research area and why you are applying.

Immediately after, follow with your current/most recent education and what you most recently learnt (modules) and specific skills.
For example, you may have learnt about a specific programming language (`R`) via a statistical module or a complex procedure through labs.

Even if it's a skill you briefly used for an assignment, or a module you didn't do your best in, it's still important to highlight because you **YOU CAN DO IT** and the degree you've done reflects that.

Not only should you mention skills from modules, but the ones you acquired during the dissertation.
Dissertation projects are usually independent work that required some of your own initiation.

Furthermore, specific skills for the PhD would benefit you.
If the PhD is focused in Genomics, you could talk about the statistics that are frequently involved (even if you haven't used them). 

From a personal experience (my PhD original title was using AI to bridge gaps in metadata to their genomic data in Biobanks): I wrote how I had an interest in Machine Learning (ML) and my interpretation of the research question and my initial thoughts of the methods that could be involved.
Then discussed the skills I have most specific to the PhD, such as ML, statistical, and database modules, the skills learnt, and the programming languages I know.
I also mentioned both past and future skills: those which I would like more knowledge in and discussed previous research projects: handling biological data (sequences) and that I independently developed my own `Python` package to answer the main research question for my dissertation.

It does depend on the type of PhD programme.
If you are a biologist who is applying for a PhD in biology but requires computational experience: you still have a great shot and you can talk about your willingness to learn computational skills to answer the biologial question.
Don't forget about the other interpersonal skills: enthusiastic, and independent, communication/presenting.
Mention all those you would best describe yourself!

## What was the interview procedure?

I actually remember my PhD interview very well! I walked in, introduced myself, and shook everyone's hand.
There was my supervisor, someone from HR, and staff who were a part of my funding body - however some people only a supervisor and a postdoc present.

It's quite common to present something, usually the prompt is a recent project.
My interview required that I discuss "my best piece of research", so I talked about my [**Masters (MSc) dissertation**]({{< relref "masters-dissertation.md" >}}).

After introductions, I led straight into a presentation. Which afterwards, the panel asked questions about.
After the presentation and presentation questions, the question was directed about myself.
My supervisor was quiet for most of the interview and asked the technical questions.

### The presentation

This section may not be revelant as some applicants aren't required to present anything.

As mentioned, my presentation was my MSc dissertation - I enjoyed and learnt a lot and confident to present that work.
I started with a little introduction about myself, my name, and that I studied my MSc in Data Science.

My presentation had the following structure:

+ introduction: "looking at a group of sequences from a fairly new phylum with many unclassified" - I had a clear research aim and introduced the bacteria.
+ brief literature: "researched that `GC` content of the sequences from the phylum seem to be consistent in groups" - I presented that I could do background research.
+ question: "can I determine which group an unclassified sequence belongs to based on the `GC` content?" - a clear and defined research question based on literature.
+ methods: "developed a `Python` package, grouping sequences based on current available data of `GC` content" - technical skills should be mentioned here: coding in `Python`, analysed sequences, obtain and sort/classify data.
+ outcome: "sequences belonging to a specific group were correctly placed - those unclassified sequences were grouped based on `GC` content: this could be useful for future knowledge of the phylum" - I contributed something to science! I also mentioned some improvements: "with more time, a ML model can be applied".

The importance of the presentation is showing communication skills, current ability, and enthusiasm.
Some panels instruct different times: some only request a 7 minute presentation then 3 minutes after for questions covering the talk.

Someone was requested the following prompt: "Something about yourself that the panel would find interesting".
Personally this is a very open question with a lot of possibilities, though I understand the struggle of what to decide to present. Perhaps you could talk about a job during your industrial year, how long have you been coding, a personal project, why you enjoy the research area, why your undergraduate course is completely different and how/why you're diverting.

### Highlighting skills in the presentation

Skills might be mentioned in your presentation (if you have one), others might come up in the questions, you'll probably mention skills in the essay. I think the panel will ask about skills which they think are relevant, e.g. the supervisor asking about how I’d handle a dataset and asking me to expand on machine learning. I would definitely mention the skills that are popular in the area, e.g. a skill in bioinformatics is being able to code. Also statistics is a good skill to mention, but don’t worry if you don’t mention it: I didn’t mention it at all (only in the application essay). I feel like it’s just a few buzzwords you need to know of your skills, e.g. currently I would say my skills in terms in buzzwords are: unsupervised machine learning: clustering; statistics: dimension reduction; natural language processing: word embeddings. But if I were to have an interview today, I would mention these in terms of projects/papers: what skills I used during particular projects to reflect for the job I'm applying for.
Some possible general skills to mention: presentation and communication skills; good listener and a keen learner; enthusiastic, independent student. During my PhD, I have found that I’ve become very independent and I'm still enthusiastic about my work. My communication skills have increased and I’m becoming more confident when I talk about my work during meetings or seminars.

### Interview questions

After a presentation, usually the first few questions are regarding the presentation.
One often difficult question is "what would you do differently?" this question means having to critique your own work. Usually research projects have an improvements/future section to consider so it'd be worth recalling those.

Technical questions may be specific methods to the presentation or the PhD.
An important thing to remember here is if a question is about a skill needed for the PhD, it's OK to say you don't know: but iterate that you're willing to learn.

One question I remember clearly from my supervisor, "what would you do if I gave you a dataset of patients with heart disease?". Knowing this project was ML-based, I decided to try and go for that angle.
I mentioned data cleaning is the first step and then said either a supervised or unsupervised method based on the aim.
Supervisor seemed to like my response, but wanted to know more and asked what I meant more specifically. 
I vaguely remember saying something like "Using `Python` I would do unsupervised clustering to look at patterns in the data." 

I found the panel wanted to know things about me. 
For example, my funding body plan group activities for that cohort of students and wanted to see if I'd be the type of person who would involve myself.
They asked questions like, "how would someone describe you?" and the question everyone dreads, "what is your biggest weakness?". I mentioned my biggest flaw was being shy, but I've overcome a lot of obstacles since my undergraduate days by involving myself in conferences. 
The panel seemed to appreciate the response and honesty.

Questions were then directed about the PhD: "do you enjoy research?" and "what do you think about the PhD project?" Personally, I love research because it gives me the chance to explore a dataset with both current and new skills. I mentioned I love presenting my work and I think they appreciated my enthusiasm!

You could mention a paper related to the PhD project - e.g. if the PhD is based on genomics then perhaps find a paper you enjoy about genomics. Maybe you could present a paper that interests you in general or a paper that was a main citation in your MSc dissertation? Personally I think they would ask this because they want to see you actually read a paper and you can talk about it (don’t worry if you can’t answer a question about it). If it were me: I would cover why the paper is interesting: do they use a particular method, are their results interesting, or do you think their conclusion is relevant? Perhaps maybe talk about what you would have done differently (e.g. what method would you do instead).

#### Trick questions

This is a tricky one: I was prepared for my interview, except for one thing: I didn’t do much background research into the supervisor! A question that was asked, "what do you know of the supervisor?" This one surprised me, but I knew of the supervisor as they were previously at my university and staff members spoke fondly of him. However I didn’t actually look into their research or papers, I knew they did ontologies, which I too enjoyed, so I mentioned that. But I’m not 100% sure if they were hoping for more.
The only trick question that I definitely didn't expect at all: "out of all your supervisors' papers, which one did you like the most?" - this one caught me off guard! Some people I spoke to afterwards said this was a very common question, so I wish I knew about it! I was completely honest and said something like, "I am really sorry but I haven't read any of their papers. But I have heard of *supervisor* and people have spoken fondly of them". I think they appreciated the honesty, and my supervisor seemed happy.

## Any final tips?
The PhD is a time to learn about various methods and techniques, so one of my tips would be don’t worry if you can’t answer a question, or even at all. As long as you have some response, if it’s “...sorry but I haven't read any of their papers…”, then they will appreciate it. But again, this is my opinion.
I personally believe a good tip is to be yourself: I felt like the main part of my interview was that they wanted to see what I wrote for the application was true. They wanted to see that I knew about the skills I put down on the application - there’s no need to lie, or exaggerate the truth. The panel wanted to know who I was as a potential researcher, they’re not there to be mean or trick you, rather to catch out people who may have written down stuff on the application which wasn’t true, yet was relevant for the PhD.
I put keywords in bold throughout my presentation slides, e.g. "sequences, Python, machine learning, bioinformatics tools, ontology". To highlight specific skills and knowledge. This really catches the eye! Furthermore I tried to say some buzzwords, “data cleaning” and “unsupervised”. Even if I never use particular skills in the PhD, by using buzzwords in my application and interview they knew what I was capable of and future potential. Some other terms that could be useful, "statistics", "GWAS", "sequencing", “genes”, “traits”, “phenotype”, and more.
Finally, maybe do a little background research of your supervisor, even it’s a few key-words, e.g. you can playback to the panel words like: ontology. But of course make sure you know what these things are! You don't need to know the inner details and the algorithms, as long as you know something about these buzzwords, your skills, and yourself: I think you'll be fine.

### Good luck!
The PhD is a learning and development journey, so even if you don't fully understand some things try not to worry: the PhD is a time for the supervisor to pass on their knowledge and you’ll learn other stuff. Good luck to anyone reading this who is preparing for a PhD application/interview. It’s not a personality contest! They just want to know you: if your skills and knowledge are fit. It’s OK to not know everything related to the PhD proposal, the PhD is a time to learn along the way, it’s OK if they ask a question you don’t know the answer to. Who knows what the panel think! I walked in my interview nervous and came out feeling positive! These are all my opinions and experience - everyone is different - and the panel will ask different things. Despite feeling like the panel wanted to know more about me and my skills, I don't actually know what they thought or said afterwards.
