# Witnessing my partner writing their PhD

My partner has just completed his PhD Viva, taking ~4.5 hours. He [monitored his heart rate and plotted it](https://twitter.com/samstudio8/status/1005537328386002944), seems quite a traumatic event.
However, the **Viva was a success**!

This blog post is to acknowledge the stress of a PhD from a friend, partner, and outsider perspective.
Although I have a new sense of appreciation for the effort that goes into a PhD journey, I don't fully understand.
I hope this post isn't misunderstood or makes it seem as if I am selfish talking about my perspective.
I am writing this blog post to acknowledge the stressful experience and what it's like to witness.

My partner, Sam, area of research is Bioinformatics and although we met at the beginning of his 3rd year, I was able to watch a rollercoaster of emotions.
Sam had fun times, and I, *in my best attempt*, tracked the funniest things said (see Figure below), and kept a subjective emotional journal during his 3rd and 4th year. I prevoiusly [tweeted about this](https://twitter.com/sap218/status/1001844614104576000).

{{< figure src="/academia/phd_emotion.jpg" caption="**Figure**: Plot showing the emotional stability in my *subjective* opinion of Dr. Sam." alt="line time plot showing the emotional stability of a phd student" >}}

I observed that his emotions varied frequently, even in times he seemed happy or grumpy, he was often saying things that would imply the opposite.
Screaming how "Bioinformatics is shit" seems like an angry thing to say yet he was laughing and seemed joyful, although it may have been the wine talking.
The stress of writing seemed to change him (not always a bad thing). Sam didn't seem himself somedays: he would wake up and write until late hours.

One major change was sleep talking. Sam, when he eventually would sleep, would sleep talk more.
Some examples of things he said: "the sequences", "bad men at the bank", and "it's real science" (the last was shouted loudly).
All things I would say are related to his PhD: sequences in Bioinformatics, bank may relate to the 4th year of no pay (abeyance), and "real science" perhaps defending his work via peer reviews.

One activity that I noticed to help was a change of scenary from the house. I would try getting Sam out of the house and suggest working in a different location.
I was writing my Masters thesis at the time so I also had the excuse to work.
We worked in different areas of the department: communal spaces, [the library](https://twitter.com/sap218/status/992734137097359360), the thinktank, and Sam most enjoyed a secret location in the Biology building's skybridge. 

Weather was a factor in Sam's mood: raining meant that he would get soaked if he went to campus so he knew he had to stay in the house (also rain reminded him of his bees and pondered if they were doing well).
I also tried to get Sam to do something different in the evenings, he found some [fun in a space game](https://twitter.com/sap218/status/982026130478727169) and [wine/mead](https://twitter.com/sap218/status/970448252389810176).


Writing up a PhD thesis seems demanding: you need to set deadlines for chapters, yet if something is not ready to write-up, how can you meet that deadline?
Some complete the PhD work first and write-up the thesis, others write as they go.
Some students work best by making schedules, however, breaks in writing was difficult for Sam, it was hard to drop concentration and then try to resume.
And when Sam was on a writing streak, he wouldn't like to stop until it was complete.

All this writing and focus meant Sam forget to eat breakfast and lunch.
I would try to grab him something to eat in the morning before he left for campus.
I found he loved the chicken coronation ciabatta from our local garage.

[Sam handed in the thesis](https://twitter.com/sap218/status/998964865086746624) and immediately I noticed a weight off his shoulders.
Now the waiting game for the Viva.

On the **successful** [Viva day](https://twitter.com/sap218/status/1005146903464611840), Sam was nervous. But absolutely rocked it.
He wore a great waistcoat and his brilliant chromosome tie.

Since the Viva, Sam had much more energy! We went on walks and explored Aberystwyth's Old College (ashamed that I had never in my 4 years in Aberystwyth had visited).

**Congratulations [Dr Sam Nicholls](https://twitter.com/samstudio8)!**

**Final note**: little did I know, I was about to embark on my PhD journey.
