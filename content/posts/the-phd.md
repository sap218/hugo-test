# Becoming a Doctor in Clinical Informatics

## Year 1

> You don't have as much experience as I would have thoughtâ€¦

This was one of the first things said to me during my first week.
Imposter syndrome was planted and settling in for the long haul.

For the first month there was no desk for me to work at and I sat alone in the quiet room. 
I felt quite isolated at first.
But tried to push forward with reading papers, following tutorials (infamous Pizza for ontologies), and playing around with a dataset.

I wanted to prove that person wrong and spent the first 9 months trying my best to impress.
But it always felt like nothing I did was good enough.
I would read about a particular method as they instructed, but they would say I'm wasting too much time reading and focus on being able to run it.
Yet, when I tried presenting results, I would be questionned about every little detail (which I would've known from further reading) - if I didn't know the smallest detail I would be berated and told I didn't know enough.

Now reflecting from experience, I would like to say that the above should not have happened.
I don't believe it's fair to say or act like that around a new student.
Sometimes I couldn't get out of bed and refused to go to the office.

My first year progress review was approaching, so I met with my supervisor about the work I've been doing for the past year, and one particular project changed things...

> I'm very impressed!

And there it was - I was a little teary. I finally felt like I knew what I was doing.
I was making my ontology & clinical pipeline correctly. I wasn't doing a bad job and in fact I was doing OK.
I continued to second guess myself but in good research practice and not because I "must have done something wrong".

This little reassurance is something I believe I should have been recieving throughout, even if I was a little slow.
There are days I still feel like a burden to people, but I was feeling better after finally having some positive feedback.

## Year 2

The second year definitely followed the "second year blues" and I was a little stuck/lost.
Although I had multiple projects in the works, I didn't know the trajectory of my PhD.

On my birthday I [presented at my first seminar](https://twitter.com/sap218/status/1225068022483836929).

And then **COVID**.

At the beginning of March, as reports of COVID was present in the UK and rumours of university staff infected, I decided to work from home. Not long after, the UK went into lockdown. 
My new office was in my house and I become quite the "agoraphobe" and struggled to leave the house (eventually persuaded to [visit the beautiful National Botanical Garden of Wales](https://twitter.com/sap218/status/1305896697705508871)).
But a **fun fact**: as a new hobby I dived deep into creative things, such as [digital art](https://twitter.com/sap218/status/1309595880190861313) and [pottery](https://twitter.com/sap218/status/1349410440821014530). 

However, during the Summer, I found a spark in my work and headed into a direction: **Patient Voice and Inflammation**.

I found a passion into looking at patient-derived data, including online-generated posts or questionnaire feedback.
I wanted to see how patients used medical terminology, what terms they were using, how they felt and the relationships with the clinical domain.

I originally hoped to look at patients with all types of inflammation but this would cover too-large a topic.
So I narrowed done to Chapter 1 **Uveitis**, Chapter 3 **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)**, and Chapter 2 covered a few acute/chronic conditions broadly.

Both **uveitis** and **IBD** are chronic inflammatory conditions...

## Year 3

> We have our heading!

The plot to this PhD was set. The data was curated from various sources and so the research followed through.
This final year was stressful as I felt a lot of pressure to produce "outstanding" results, but also enjoyable as I really found my passion for research.

## Writing-up

Writing-up the PhD was quite the experience.

I previously watched my [partner complete their PhD]({{< ref "/outsider-perspective-of-phd" >}}) and somewhat knew what was coming.
