# Fashun: an `R Shiny` app of fashion trends

Scenario: setting the scene. I have just handed in my PhD thesis and now not sure what to do with my time. What skills can I learn? From my interest in text mining and sentiment analysis, I thought how could I expand upon these areas of interest?
A project emerged! Fashion trends!

I enjoy fashion. By "fashion" I mean wearing unique outfits that make me feel good about myself. And so I want to state that fashion is whatever you want it to be: wearing multiple patterns, socks with sandles, or wearing crocs.

Using Google Trends, Twitter API, and RShiny I created a project that looks at fashion trends, correlations, and sentiment analysis.


A lot more information and result interpretation can be read in the detailed site (below).
With the RShiny app available too!
