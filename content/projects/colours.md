# Rainbow project

## Indigo

Indigo is a to-do list via the command line written in Python.

I found myself in some meetings unable to multi-task: listening whilst trying to hand-write notes. I usually end up rushing these, which then become unreadable. I made Indigo to make my note-taking easier as my typing skills are fast and I can always understand these notes.

Indigo was designed for quick note taking which any important tasks should probably be written down, e.g. an email to those in the meeting to let them know what you wrote.
You can add and complete tasks, however there is room for improvement with editing tasks or setting deadlines. Additionally, a current issue is that if a user does not exit the program properly (keyboard interruption error) then the list will disappear. But Indigo encourages users to exit and save by typing n.

This is my first fun programming script: I hope to make more in the future!
